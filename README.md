# Multiple-Linear-Regression (Credit data set)
Hey there! I am new to Data Science, so please review my work. Any kind of feedback is welcomed!

The purpose of this notebook is to gain a deeper understanding of linear regression by applying it to the "Credit" dataset. I will try to go through the steps from pre processing the data to checking the model assumptions.

Steps taken:

1. Clean data
2. Quick analysis
3. Build simple model
4. Check model assumptions
    - linearity
    - normality
    - homoscedasticity
    - no multicollinearity
